random checks for a pseudo-random sequence of allocs/frees. 

The following performance rests were run with timeout set to 15 seconds:
random 0 100 0
random 0 1000 1
random 0 100000 1
random 0 500000 1
random 0 2000000 0

In addition, we conducted a number of correctness tests. Following are short descriptions of what each test checks for:

        align           check for 8-byte alignment
        align2          do multiple alignments and check for 8-byte alignment
        align3          do multiple odd-sized allocations and check for 8-byte alignment
        alloc           simple 8-byte allocation
        alloc2          a few aligned allocations
        alloc3          several odd-sized allocations
        badinit         bad args to Mem_Init - 0
        badinit2        (same) - negative integer
        worstfit        use worstfit policy for space allocation
        coalesce        check for coalesce of free space
        coalesce2       (same)
        coalesce3       (same)
        coalesce4       same, but check that there's no space left
        coalesce5       same, but different pointer freed
        coalesce6       same, but check for header size free
        doubleinit      call init twice
        free            simple allocation and free
        free2           aligned allocation and free
        free3           odd-sized allocation and free
        init            initialize with size of 1 page
        init2           initialize and round up to 1 page
        nospace         no space left to allocate
        nullfree        try to free a NULL pointer
        writeable       check that memory can be written to after allocation
