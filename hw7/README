DESIGN DETAILS:
===============
The format function creates a FAT 16 disk image. The disk can be upto 50 MB big and should work fine with the librabry. 
The fat librabry can be used to read and write to the disk. It can make and remove files. It can also make and remove 
directories. The file system is mounted on the root directory. It supports a hierarchical directory structure and can 
differentiate between files and directories created by either a regualar user or a super user. The super user can access
all files and directories. The regular user can only access files and directories created by them. 
The shell is pretty simple. It can run built in commands and can redirect output. It can also run the file system functions.
It has only a few of the specified builtin commands implemented. However, these commands are not implemented fully. 

How to Compile:
===============
    make mysh 
    make format
    make test1
    make test2
    make test3
    
       
How to Run:
===========
    ./mysh

    ./format DISK -s 1

    ./test1

    ./test2

    ./test3

Implementation Details:
=======================
1. File System Library Funtions
    a. f_open - implemented and tested
    b. f_read - implemented and tested
    c. f_read - implemented and tested
    d. f_close - implemented and tested
    l. f_mkdir - implemented and tested
    m. f_rmdir - implemented and tested

    h. f_remove - implemented
    i. f_opendir - implemented
    j. f_readdir - implemented
    k. f_closedir - implemented

    e. f_seek - not implemented
    f. f_rewind - not implemented
    g. f_stat - not implemented 

Test Descriptions
------------------
1. test_dir.c - makes and removes directories in DISK
2. test_fopen.c - opens multiple files in different modes. creates many files to test space limits
3. test_write_read.c - writes files of different sizes and then tries different number of bights from them    

The tested file system functions work almost perfectly. The tests are made to test their robustness. Before running each test make sure run ./format DISK -s 1 so the tests work properly. 

2. The Shell 
    on start up the shell can look for DISK where the file system is located. if "DISK" not found is prints our message asking to run format
    it mounts itself on root directory once it has found the file system
    it displays a log in prompt, allowing you to log in as either a SUPERUSER or a REGULAR USER
    it supports redirection of shell commands but not built in commands

    Buiiltin Cmds that Work: 
    a. ls 
    c. mkdir 
    d. rmdir 
    e. cd 

    These commands are the only ones integrated with the file library but they do not work perfectly

3. MISC
    the format utility file works as specified in the assignment document. it will creat a DISK of upto 50 MB. 


Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    certain file library functions do not work as expected and have memory issues.
