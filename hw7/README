How to Compile:
===============
    make mysh 

    make format

    make test
       
How to Run:
===========
    ./mysh

    ./format DISK -s 1

    ./test
	
Implementation Details:
=======================
1. File System Library
    a. f_open - can open a file. if file does not exit, and mode is WRITE_ONLY, a file will be created
    b. f_read - will read the specified number of bytes if the mode of the handle is READ_ONLY or READ_WRITE
    c. f_read - will write the specified number of bytes if the mode of the handle is READ_WRITE or WRITE_ONLY
    d. f_close - closes a file
    e. f_seek - not implemented
    f. f_rewind - not implemented
    g. f_stat - 
    h. f_remove -
    i. f_opendir
    j. f_readdir -
    k. f_closedir - 
    l. f_mkdir - 
    m. f_rmdir - 

2. The Shell 
    on start up the shell can look for DISK where the file system is located. if "DISK" not found is prints our message asking to run format
    it mounts itself on root directory once it has found the file system
    it displays a log in prompt, allowing you to log in as either a SUPERUSER or a REGULAR USER
    it supports redirection of shell commands but not built in commands

    Buiiltin Cmds that Work: 
    a. ls 
    c. mkdir 
    d. rmdir 
    e. cd 
    i. rm 

3. MISC
    the format utility file works as specified in the assignment document. 

Special Instructions to the grader:
===================================
As needed -- but generally your code should need no special instructions

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    As needed.  Being forthcoming about bugs is good.  An effective bug analysis will reduce the
    penalty for having that bug by up to 50%.
