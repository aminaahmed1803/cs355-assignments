Upon the Tainted Sorrow,

Today, the snowflakes fall so harsh.

Upon the Tainted Sorrow,

Today, even the strong wind gusts.

The Tainted Sorrow is

Just like a fox’s hooded fur.

The Tainted Sorrow is

Covered by snowflakes and it cowers.

The Tainted Sorrow has

Nothing to desire and nothing to wish.

The Tainted Sorrow has

A dream of death to its wary self.

Upon the Tainted Sorrow,

Trembling like a pitiful soul.

Upon the Tainted Sorrow,

Nowhere to belong, the sun sets......

=====================================

By your sorrow you have already tainted
This morning’s freshly fallen snow.
By your sorrow you have already tainted
Even a strong wind that blows.

Already tainted by sorrow
Is a fox's splendid fur used for a coat.
Already tainted by sorrow
Is the snowflake that shrinks before it falls.

By becoming tainted by sorrow
You never hope nor wish for anything
By becoming tainted by sorrow
You languidly linger on dreams of death

For the tainted sorrow is a painful,
Intimidating foreboding.  
For the tainted sorrow is upon me.
It is dusk, and there is nothing I can do……
